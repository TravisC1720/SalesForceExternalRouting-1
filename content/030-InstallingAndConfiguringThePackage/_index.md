# Installing and Configuring the Package
Before you can install the package, you need to be sure that you have completed all the prerequisites on this page: https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/install-and-configure-the-genesys-cloud-for-salesforce-external-routing-package/

Please follow the steps below to Install and Configure the Genesys Cloud for SalesForce External Routing package.
1. Install the package by navigating to this link https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t5e000000vlIF
2. Choose either "Install for All Users" or "Install for Specific Profiles" depending on your preference

This is all we need to do for this step. In the next step, we will create our Genesys Cloud configuration components and then sync them over to our SalesForce account using the package we just installed.
